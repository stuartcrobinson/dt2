let's give up on deep tweeter.

 re deeptweeter - the chance that i would be able to generate meaningful text seems extremely unlikely.

 goal is to respond to bad/mean tweets with relevant nice things to say, so the ML challenge is
 appropriately fitting nice statements with the mean tweet.

 new approach:

 AutoThoughts

 - have dataset of nice quotes.  per quote, have expanded form:  per non stopword, list of top 5 synonyms.
 - then, for mean tweet, transform into nonstopword synonyms (root words including original)
 - then use transformed tweet as search query for nice quote.
 - get the reason for matching - the most-shared words/synonyms -- make these the hashtags
